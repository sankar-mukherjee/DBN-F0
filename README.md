----

data_preprocess_class.m => Preprosessing of data when output F0 is considered as class ranging from 75Hz-500Hz

data_preprocess_reg.m => Preprosessing of data when output F0 is considered as a single value

mse_xcorr_syn_class.m  =>  f0 prediction as Class (330 class). load different nn weights and sentence_id see the graph
dbn_dnn_class_serial.m  => DBN with output F0 as class

SAE_traning.m  => stacked denoising autoencoder 

/reports  => performance of different setup
